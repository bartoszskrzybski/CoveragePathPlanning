# Hybrid Watershed + Grid Algorithm Details

### Core Concept : The algorithm combines **watershed decomposition** for environment-adaptive segmentation with **rectangular grid normalization** for generating safe, efficient coverage paths.

### Algorithm Architecture:

Phase 1: Watershed Decomposition & Zone Creation
    
    Input: Safe space map, peak_distance, min_cell_area
    Output: Watershed-based cells for coverage planning
    
    1. Calculate distance transform:
       - Apply Euclidean distance transform to safe space
       - Assign obstacle distance values to each pixel
    
    2. Find watershed peaks:
       - Detect local maxima using PEAK_MIN_DISTANCE separation
       - Peaks become centers of future cells
    
    3. Apply watershed segmentation:
       - Use negative distance transform for watershed algorithm
       - Segment space using peaks as seeds
    
    4. Create valid cells:
       - Filter cells by MIN_CELL_AREA threshold
       - Create cell objects from labeled regions

Phase 2: Rectangular Grid Generation with Ultra-Safe Validation
python
    
    Input: Rectangle grid within watershed cells
    Output: Ultra-safe zigzag waypoints with full validation
    
    1. Create safe zigzag pattern with validation:
       - FOR each row of rectangles:
            Determine direction: even rows LEFT_TO_RIGHT, odd rows RIGHT_TO_LEFT
            FOR each rectangle in continuous segments:
                IF rectangle center is ultra-safe AND line is completely safe:
                    Add rectangle center to waypoints
       - Return validated zigzag sequence
    
    2. Ultra-safe point validation:
       - Check all 8 surrounding pixels (3×3 neighborhood)
       - IF any surrounding pixel is unsafe: return FALSE
       - ELSE: return TRUE (ultra-safe)

Phase 3: Path Planning & Advanced Optimization
python

    Input: Watershed cells with internal coverage paths
    Output: Optimized cell sequence, inter-cell transition paths
    
    1. Plan optimal cell sequence using TSP nearest neighbor:
       - Start from first cell
       - WHILE not all cells visited:
            Find nearest unvisited cell by distance to current.end_point
            Add to sequence and update current cell
       - Return optimized cell visiting sequence
    
    2. Create enhanced A* roadmap between cells:
       - FOR each consecutive cell pair:
            Generate A* path from current.end_point to next.start_point
            Apply path densification for smooth transitions
            Store transition path in roadmap
       - Return complete inter-cell roadmap

# 🛡️ Safety Features

    Ultra-Safe Validation: 3×3 neighborhood checking around each point

    Complete Line Safety: Verification of entire path segments

    Adaptive Grid Sizing: Rectangle dimensions adjusted to robot width

    Obstacle-Aware Segmentation: Watershed decomposition based on obstacle proximity

# ⚙️ Parameter Optimization

    PEAK_MIN_DISTANCE: Controls minimum distance between cell centers

        Large maps: 45 pixels

        Small maps: 20 pixels
        
    Note: This parameter requires manual adjustment in the code based on map size

    MIN_CELL_AREA: Filters out excessively small segments

    Safety Margins: Configurable based on robot constraints

    Modified Regulated Pure Pursuit Controller in global Nav2 parameters:

    /opt/ros/humble/share/nav2_bringup/params/nav2_params.yaml

# Environment Mapping Procedure

### Step 1: SLAM with Cartographer

    # Terminal 1: Launch Gazebo simulation
    ros2 launch my_gazebo_maps gazebo_launch.py world_name:=<map_name>.world

    # Terminal 2: Start Cartographer SLAM
    ros2 launch turtlebot3_cartographer cartographer.launch.py use_sim_time:=True

    # Terminal 3: Manual robot control
    ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard

### Step 2: Map Preservation

    # Save generated environment representation
    ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f <map_name>

# Coverage Execution Workflow
### Three-Terminal Launch System

    Terminal 1 - Simulation Environment
    ros2 launch my_gazebo_maps gazebo_launch.py world_name:=<map_name>.world

    Terminal 2 - Navigation Stack

    cd ~/CoveragePathPlanning
    ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py \
    use_sim_time:=true \
    map:=maps\<map_name>.yaml \
    params_file:=/opt/ros/humble/share/nav2_bringup/params/nav2_params.yaml

    Terminal 3 - Algorithm Execution

    cd ~/CoveragePathPlanning
    python3 watershed_grid_hybrid.py

Note:  You have to adjust map_name in file in follow line:

    self.map_name = "map_test"
